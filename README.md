# Particle_swarm_optimization_testing
Working on a Particle Swarm Optimization on prop99 dataset. This work is inspired by Tom Beers work from 2020. My thought was to use my background in optimization and parameter tuning to create a model that more closely resembles the prop99 actual data, but the tuning did not turn out as expected.
